# AI-Powered Face Recognition System

This project is an AI-powered face recognition system using ESP32-CAM modules and the Ultralytics YOLO object detection model. It enables real-time video streaming and face detection, designed for scalable applications in surveillance and monitoring.

Features
 - Real-time video streaming from multiple ESP32-CAM modules
 - High accuracy face detection using YOLO object detection
 - Centralized monitoring of multiple video feeds
 - Supports concurrent connections from multiple clients using socket programming
 - Displays each video feed in a separate window for easy monitoring

Technologies Used

 - ESP32-CAM: Hardware module for capturing video
 - Python: Server-side processing and socket management
 - OpenCV: Image processing and pre-processing for YOLO
 - YOLO (Ultralytics): Object detection model for accurate face detection
 - Socket Programming: Manages multiple client connections for real-time streaming
 - Arduino IDE: Used to program the ESP32-CAM modules
